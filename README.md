### ***Description***
Welcome to Memory flash cards! (title in work)

 This is my first attempt at a README. I am going to build a memory flash card browser game. I'm going to create the HTML, style with CSS, and code logic with JS. I am using trello.com to help organize me to make to build go easier. For more reference for the steps, go to: https://trello.com/b/3OVUSKZu/snake-game

 I created functions to "flip" the card and to check it they are a match.

 Thank you for your patience as I build this out into something amazing.

### ***Updates***

I am going to add a restart and work on add a scoring system.
